## Introduction

This project aims to implement a machine learning model to solve a specific problem. The model will be trained on a labeled dataset and tested on unseen data to evaluate its performance.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.6 or newer
- TensorFlow or scikit-learn
- The labeled dataset used for training and testing

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the labeled dataset and place it in the `data` directory
4. Open the `train.py` file and specify the path to the dataset
5. Run the training script using `python train.py`

## Usage

Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data. To do this, open the `predict.py` file and specify the path to the model and the input data. Then run the script using `python predict.py`.

## Results

The performance of the trained model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The results will be reported in the `results.txt` file.

## Conclusion

In this project, we implemented a machine learning model to solve a specific problem. The model was trained on a labeled dataset and its performance was evaluated on unseen data. The results show that the model performs well on the given task.

Thank you for using this project.
